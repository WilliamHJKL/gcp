GCP Sample Projects for Autocomplete 
========

What I've done so far with this.
--------

- Forked the repo from https://github.com/rickcrawford/gcp.
- Change reference to my repo. (SED is your friend)

- You need to create a project with a bucket that host the bestbuy files.
- Then you need to populate a google datastore, the easyest way is to do it from the google console.
- `go run tools/post/main.go`
